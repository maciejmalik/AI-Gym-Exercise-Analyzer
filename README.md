# AI-Gym-Exercise-Analyzer
A deep learningâ€“based application for automatic recognition and technique evaluation of selected gym exercises using user-submitted video recordings. 
The app supports four common exercises:  Squat  Bench Press  Barbell Curl  Push-up
Accepts video input using interface made with gradio
Exercise classification using TensorFlow-based neural networks
Pose estimation and movement tracking via MediaPipe
Technologies Used:
- TensorFlow
- MediaPipe
- OpenCV
The training dataset includes videos:
- Collected from publicly available internet sources
- Recorded manually for this project to improve model accuracy and diversity
